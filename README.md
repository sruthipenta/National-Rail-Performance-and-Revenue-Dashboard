As a BI Developer for National Rail, I'm tasked with developing exploratory dashboard that provides key insights into the companyâ€™s operations. This dashboard aims to help identify the most popular routes, determine peak travel times, analyze revenue from different ticket types and classes, and diagnose on-time performance and contributing factors. This dashboard will ultimately empower managers to make data-driven decisions, improve customer satisfaction, and drive overall business success.
Scope:
The dashboard will cover the following key areas:
Popular Routes: Identify routes with the highest ticket sales.
Peak Travel Times: Determine times with the highest passenger volumes.
Revenue Analysis: Analyze revenue from various ticket types and classes.
On-Time Performance: Evaluate train punctuality and identify factors contributing to delays or cancellations.
Data Sources:
The data contains mock train ticket sales for National Rail in the UK, from January to April 2024, including details on the type of ticket, the date & time for each journey, the departure & arrival stations, the ticket price, and more.
Key Assumptions:
When creating an interactive dashboard, it's crucial to understand the intended purpose and the questions the users seek to answer. Although I was unable to chat with the stakeholders directly, I made the following key assumptions to guide the design of the National Rail Performance and Revenue Dashboard:
Primary Objectives of the Dashboard:
The main goal for National Rail managers is to gain a comprehensive view of train operations and revenue generation, providing actionable insights.
Key questions they want to answer include:
Which routes are the most popular?
What are the peak travel times?
How does revenue break down by ticket type and class?
What factors contribute to on-time performance issues, and where are the delays occurring?
